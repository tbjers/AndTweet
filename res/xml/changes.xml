                <change>Fixed: Sometimes twitter.com succeeds to create/delete favorite,

                   Sometimes it fails, but doesn't indicate error...
                   (Maybe this is twitter.com feature...?!)</change>

        <change>
            Working offline or in bad connection conditions is
            implemented.
            Now User doesn't have to wait for the "Command execution
            on a Server" after updating his status (i.e. sending a tweet)
            and may continue reading and
            writing tweets, making them Favorite etc.
            while AndTweet stores all the
            commands in the queue and retries delivery
            upon every automatic update and also
            during any manual command (Reload or Status update).
            User is being notified about number of messages
            currently in the Output queue
            (If
            Notifications are being enabled).
            Queues of unsent commands persist in the phone's memory. 
            Even after shutdown for Android v.1.6 and up.</change>
        <change>Changes in the application permissions.
            Two (location)
            permissions were removed, one permission was added
            to help
            asynchronous message delivery (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE).</change>
        <change>Improved user experience during initial configuration till first tweets loading</change>
        <change>"Verify" preference moved to the top of the "User
            Credentials"
            preference's
            section, because User can really start from tapping it
            (typing Username is not required for OAuth)!</change>
        <change>Widget shows last time when data was successfully
            downloaded from the server, not when there was last attempt to do
            this (maybe it failed...)</change>
        <change>New Preference "Minimum logging level" added to allow changing 
            Logging level from within the application Preferences.</change>
        <change>Another pass of timeline code cleaning. Now AndTweet's
            timelines open
            faster thanks to less requests and redrawing.</change>
        <change>Fixed issue 12 "Themes do not apply until app is restarted"</change>
        <change>Fixed bug preventing timeline position restore.</change>
        <change>Fixed errors loading data from the Internet due to
            parallel
            OAuth requests. (e.g. during initial loading of the User's timeline).</change>
        <change>Fixed blank screen in Preferences activity during
            authentication
            after redirect from Twitter web site.</change>
        <change>Fixed "black on black" tweet text on "Single tweet"
            window on
            Android v.2.3.3</change>

			<package android:versionName="1.1.3" android:versionCode="39"
				versionDate="2011-07-16">
				1. Queued tweet sending implemented. Now User doesn't
				have to wait for the "Command execution on a Server"
				and may continue reading and writing tweets.
				Moreover, the same "(close to the) Guaranteed message delivery"
				approach works
				for the other commands also: Timeline reload,
				Favorites creation and deletion.
				AndTweet retries to send commands to the server on every
				automatic update and during any manual command or message
				(Reload or Status update). User is being notified
				about number of messages currently in the queue
				(If Notifications are being enabled).
				2. Changes in the application permissions.
				Two (location) permissions were removed,
				one permission was added to help asynchronous message delivery
				(ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE).
	</package>
			<package android:versionName="1.1.2" android:versionCode="38"
				versionDate="2011-04-29">
				1. Fixed bug preventing timeline position restore.
				2. Fixed errors loading data from the Internet due to parallel
				OAuth requests. (e.g. during initial loading of the User's
				timeline).
				3. Another pass of timeline code cleaning. Now AndTweet's
				timelines open faster thanks to less requests and redrawing.
				4. Made first step in switching from parallel
				and, in fact, synchronous requests (Twitter commands) processing to
				the sequential and queued processing, see {@link
				com.xorcode.andtweet.TimelineActivity#queueIntent}
	</package>
			<package android:versionName="1.1.1" android:versionCode="37"
				versionDate="2011-04-01">
				1. Blank screen in Preferences activity during
				authentication after redirect from Twitter web site
				2. "Verify"
				preference moved to the top of the "User Credentials" preference's
				section, because User can really start from tapping it (typing
				Username is not required for OAuth)!
	</package>
			<package android:versionName="1.1.0" android:versionCode="36"
				versionDate="2011-03-12">
				1. Fixed "black on black" tweet text on "Single tweet"
				window on Android v.2.3.3
				2. Style definitions in
				"res/values/themes.xml" reworked.
	</package>
		</history>
	</release>
	<release android:versionName="1.0.5" android:versionCode="35"
		versionDate="2011-02-19">
		1. "Favorites" list added.
		2. Favorites are protected from
		automatic deletion (unlike other old tweets)
		3. Click on Widget opens
		the timeline, that has something new, in this order: messages,
		mentions, tweets
		4. Maximum History time (to store tweets) is 1 year
		now
		5. OAuth is On By Default.
		6. Mentions are not "quick Search" any
		more, they are just another type of "Timeline". So we may search in
		Mentions also.
		7. "Automatic updates" setting is not being turned off
		by the System. (in beta1:)
		8. Fixed issue: Old records are not being
		deleted.
